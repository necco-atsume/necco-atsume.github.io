title: Welcome to my Bad Code Opinion Zone!
---

Hello! ❤️ I'm Claire, and here's where I'll be blogging about my personal projects, and dumping all
my thoughts about coding, gardening, and games. I'm a (Today - February 1992) year old trans lady
who works as a full-stack developer but moonlights as a hobby game developer and (slow) speedrunner. 
My pronouns are she/her, and my favorite food is pizza. 

Here's some of the things I've done in the past:
  * [HappyGB](https://github.com/necco-atsume/happygb): A sort-of-approaching-minimally-functional C# gameboy emulator.
  * [OrgPlay](https://github.com/necco-atsume/orgplay): A player for Organya chiptune files (the
    file format used in Cave Story).
  * And that's pretty much it! 

And here's what I'm working on right now:
  * Dash: A JS game making toolkit with a focus on making the games easy to make and share. I'll post a bit more about this once I've got someting to show. 
  * Peppers: I'm growing some hot peppers on my balcony.
